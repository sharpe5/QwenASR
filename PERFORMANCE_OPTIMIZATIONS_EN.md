# QwenASR Performance Optimizations

This document catalogs the performance optimizations implemented in the pure-Rust QwenASR CPU inference engine, achieving 41+ RTF on Apple M5.

## 1. Memory Traffic & Allocation Reduction

- **INT8 Quantization for Decoder**: Decoder weights (`QKV`, `O`-projection, `FFN` gate/up/down, `lm_head`) are quantized to INT8 with per-row scales at load time. This cuts memory traffic by ~4x compared to FP32 and avoids BF16-to-F32 conversion overhead. Implemented via NEON INT8 matvec/argmax kernels.
- **Reusable Workspaces**: Eliminated transient heap allocations in hot paths.
  - **Encoder**: `EncoderBuffers` persists scratch spaces for `chunk_mel`, convolution variables, and `im2col`. The main activation buffer (`x`) and `window_starts` metadata are reused across calls.
  - **Decoder**: `DecoderBuffers` provides pre-allocated scratch for BF16-to-F32 conversions, removing ~140 allocations per prefill pass.
  - **Transcription**: Embedding assembly buffers are reused instead of being reallocated per chunk.
- **Static Weight Prepacking**: Multi-token decoder prefill weights are preconverted from BF16 to F32 at load time and stored in a reusable matrix. This skips repetitive conversions across streaming chunks or segmented prefills.

## 2. Kernel Fusion & Cache Locality

- **Fused Residual Adds**: Replaced separate `y = y + x` loops with `linear_accumulate` and `linear_nobias_bf16_addto`. Matvec/GEMM operations accumulate directly into the destination residual buffer, saving read/write passes.
- **Fused Matvec + SwiGLU**: A fused kernel computes the `gate_up` projection and applies the `SwiGLU` activation in one pass, keeping intermediate values in L1 cache.
- **Head-Contiguous KV Cache**: Cache layout is `[layer][head][pos][head_dim]`. Storing heads contiguously improves spatial locality and reduces cache misses during causal attention scans.

## 3. SIMD & Platform Acceleration

- **Explicit SIMD Intrinsics**: 
  - Vectorized `rms_norm`, `gelu`, and `swiglu` using fast polynomial exponential approximations.
  - RoPE uses NEON vector code for pairwise sub-vector rotations.
  - Bulk BF16 conversions use `vshll_n_u16` (NEON) and `_mm256_cvtepu16_epi32` (AVX2).
- **Apple Accelerate & vDSP**: Dense linear algebra (causal attention scores, mel spectrogram generation) is offloaded to Accelerate (BLAS). Uses `vvexpf` for batched softmax exponentiation and `vDSP_dotpr` for AMX coprocessor utilization.

## 4. Threading & Concurrency

- **Lock-Free Thread Pool Fast Path**: Work scheduling uses atomics and spin-waiting before falling back to mutex/condvar sleep, reducing OS context-switch latency for micro-jobs.
- **Threaded Non-Matmul Operations**: Parallelized operations beyond GEMMs:
  - `im2col` packing for encoder convolutions.
  - `gelu` and `swiglu` activations over large FFN buffers.
  - Bidirectional attention across attention heads.

## 5. Algorithmic Improvements

- **Silence Compaction**: Energy-based VAD preprocesses audio to strip non-speech segments. Edge padding is reduced to 2 windows and extra non-voice hangover is eliminated, minimizing data sent to the encoder.
- **Lazy Encoder Re-encoding**: In streaming mode, the partial encoder tail is only re-encoded every other chunk. This provides near-perfect Longest Common Prefix (LCP) reuse and reduces decoder prefill cost by ~50% on skipped chunks.
- **Online Softmax**: Single-token causal attention uses an online softmax scan, combining score tracking, normalization, and value accumulation into a single loop. This avoids temporary score buffer allocations and separate exponentiation passes for `seq_len = 1` queries.
